# Study Spot - Find Your Perfect Study Partner

Welcome to the Study Spot mobile app repository! This project was developed as part of the EGR302 (Design and Documentation) course by our dedicated team of 5 during [semester/year]. Study Spot is designed to make your campus study experience more collaborative and efficient.

## About Study Spot

Studying alone can be challenging, and finding the perfect spot on campus can be equally daunting. With Study Spot, you can:

- **Find Study Partners**: Connect with fellow students who are studying for the same subjects, making your study sessions more productive and enjoyable.

- **Create Study Groups**: Form study groups with your classmates, facilitating group discussions and collaboration.

- **Claim Study Spots**: Reserve specific study spots on campus so that others know they're in use, reducing the uncertainty of finding an available spot.

## Technologies and Methodologies Used

- **Agile Development**: We followed an Agile development framework, allowing us to adapt and respond to changing requirements and feedback throughout the project.

- **Scrum**: We employed Scrum, an Agile framework, to manage our project. This helped us organize our work into sprints, conduct regular stand-up meetings, and prioritize tasks effectively.

- **Jira**: We used Jira as our project management tool to track tasks, user stories, and issues, ensuring a streamlined workflow and clear project progress tracking.
